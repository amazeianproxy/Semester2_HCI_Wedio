Project Name: WeDio

Background and Theme: Entertainment

“WEDIO” is a social media application with the concept of “sharing voices”, where WEDIO becomes a social media in the form of social "audio media", where everyone can contribute and report everything in audio format. The audio format can be listened to without disturbing user activities. This application was created with a vision and mission to present social content in other formats that do not interfere with daily activities. The theme revolves around entertainment and information, a kind of social media in the form of audio, similar to short-form content; but in the form of audio. The content is presented in the form of posts that can be given a box image thumbnail (similar to a disc label) and has two sectors that interact with its users; namely, a comment column to provide input and criticism of the content; and the column “What is your vibe?” as a virtual community where users can express their imagination about what they think when listening to the content. Thumbnails are used to support audio functionality in this application which allows information to be provided in the form of audio without having to open a tab or open a cellphone (running in the background).

Method used: UCD (User Centred Design) 

We chose UCD because the project's goal is more to benefit the user and has a focus on the user experience in the social aspect of this project. Users have the majority focus on the experience of sharing and receiving audio in our project, so users must also be focused as an element in this project. In today's era, many people demand instant things, we target consumers who need instant information, entertainment, and news without hindering their daily activities.

As such, the things we did according to UCD:
Find out more about user or market needs.
This research will be conducted using a short interview method. At least five people will be interviewed on several topics related to our project and social media like our project. The participants who will be the main target are young people who often use social media such as Instagram, X (Twitter), and even Tiktok. The questions that will be submitted will focus on opinions about social media that prioritize audio over other elements and invite users' imaginations to interact more creatively. We will then sort these qualitative results into smaller categories to determine our priorities and more similar opinions to ensure the quality of interesting and unique social media.

Through the research results obtained, we will continue to build a design according to market needs.
In the main/initial concept application, it will be designed with a minimalist concept and with not too much color contrast; the focus of color will remain on the content created by the user. Our project will also have two modes, namely light mode and dark mode. The main color of the project will be determined based on the opinions of participants who will be received after a short interview is conducted. Like social media in general, we will provide general features such as comments, descriptions, and titles for each post; plus some additional features that we have created specifically to enhance the user experience. As the application progresses, we will continue to receive feedback and improve the UI and UX aspects according to the feedback received.

After going through the design development process, an evaluation of the design will be carried out by listening to opinions from third parties (feedback). 
When the application design has been created, we will receive feedback from third parties by providing a prototype of the design results to be tried directly. We will ask for feedback and other things that we can develop further in the design aspect. The functional aspect will also be a question that we will convey in order to obtain information about market interest in more depth. Then we will categorize the feedback given such as criticism of the UI, suggestions for additional features, or feedback on the user experience that needs to be improved. With that, we can continuously develop the application and adjust it to the needs of the majority of prospective WeDio users. 

After that, we will implement and iterate various features and aspects of elements in this project. 
Applications with a fairly mature design will be developed into a web app and app that can run and can be used by everyone. After completing the development stage, we will distribute and implement the application in a testing period. Then we will provide a section so that users can rate the application and report technical or visual bugs. Then with this input, we will iterate again in the design or development process.
